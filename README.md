## How it works

You create an account with a username and password which writes to Firebases authentication server.

The data returned from Firebase is then saved in the Redis database with some additional fields the app will later request.

Once the initial account creation process is complete, you are taken to your dashboard where you will have the ability to add your credit cards.

After a card is entered you can view its data and update at any point.

You can filter credit card transaction data based on certain data points.

### How the data is stored:

## Users
- first name (chris)
- last name (jones)
- authentication id (unique, generated by firebase)
- email (john@doe.com)
- cards (an array of card ids) ['s9djf93j2pii','jasodi923hdo']

## Cards
- name (Cap1 Travel Purchases)
- issuer (visa)
- limit (1000)
- balance (500)
- expirationDate (0667 formatted to 06/67)
- lastFour (4358676905850948 only last 4 is shown)
- cvv (194)
- bgColor (#8700f5)

### How the data is accessed:

- upon api endpoint requests from the client

### Performance Benchmarks

- Simply using redis to store cached users cards
